# TBSA - Apartment Building Management System

## Project Overview

TBSA (Thermal Building System Administration) is a comprehensive web application for managing apartment buildings, designed for Romanian apartment complexes. The system serves two main user types: **Administrators** (who manage buildings) and **Owners** (apartment owners/tenants who submit water meter readings).
