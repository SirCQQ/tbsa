      "taskTitle": "Implement Authentication Middleware",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication middleware implementation into steps for token verification, role-based access control, error handling, Next.js integration, and session management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex security mechanisms, integration with Next.js, and handling various authentication scenarios, warranting a high complexity score and multiple subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Buildings CRUD API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Buildings CRUD API implementation into separate endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting buildings, including validation and error handling for each.",
      "reasoning": "While CRUD operations are standard, the complexity comes from implementing proper validation, relationship handling, and ensuring secure access across multiple endpoints."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Apartments CRUD API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Apartments CRUD API implementation into individual endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting apartments, with focus on validation and relationship handling.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the Buildings API, this task requires careful handling of relationships and validation, but with added complexity due to associations with buildings and owners."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Water Readings CRUD API with Consumption Calculation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Water Readings API implementation into subtasks for CRUD operations, consumption calculation logic, validation rules, deadline enforcement, business logic integration, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need for accurate consumption calculations, enforcing business rules, handling deadlines, and managing complex validation scenarios."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Admin Dashboard implementation into subtasks for data fetching and processing, UI component creation, and integration of overview statistics and management interfaces.",
      "reasoning": "While involving multiple data points and UI components, this task is primarily focused on data presentation and doesn't involve complex business logic, resulting in a moderate complexity score."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Building Management Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Building Management Interface implementation into subtasks for the buildings list view, add building form, edit building functionality, and delete building feature.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive management interface with multiple CRUD operations and form handling, warranting a moderately high complexity score and several subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Reading Validation Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Reading Validation Interface implementation into subtasks for the pending readings list, validation form design, approval/rejection logic, state management, and validation history tracking.",
      "reasoning": "The complexity here stems from implementing a robust validation workflow, managing complex state, and integrating with the backend for final decision processing."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Owner Dashboard implementation into subtasks for apartment overview creation, reading status display, and submission reminder functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily focused on data presentation and basic user interactions, resulting in a moderate complexity score with fewer recommended subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Reading Submission Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Reading Submission Interface implementation into subtasks for form structure creation, real-time validation logic, consumption preview calculator, submission handling logic, and component integration and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex form handling, real-time calculations, and validation, warranting a high complexity score and multiple subtasks to ensure a robust implementation."
